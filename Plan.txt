Choosing the Right Statistical Methods:

Since your outcome variable "Obese" is binary (Yes/No), you'll likely use logistic regression. This is the standard method for modeling binary outcomes and understanding the relationships between predictors and the probability of obesity.
Consider using chi-squared tests to examine the association between categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Employment, Veg, Fruit, AgeGroup) and obesity. This can be a good preliminary step before building your logistic regression model.
If you are looking at the change of obesity over time, you can also use a Logistic regression model with year as a continous variable, to see if there is a trend.
Model Building and Selection:

Start by building a basic logistic regression model with relevant predictors (AgeGroup, Sex, Employment, Veg, Fruit, Year).
Consider building more complex models, for example adding interaction terms. For example, is the effect of age different for males and females?
Use model selection techniques (e.g., AIC, BIC, stepwise regression) to determine the most parsimonious and well-fitting model. Justify your model selection process.
Ensure to show the final model that you have selected.
Model Evaluation and Diagnostics:

Goodness-of-fit:
Assess the overall fit of your logistic regression model using metrics like the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
Calculate pseudo-R-squared values (e.g., McFadden's R-squared) to get a sense of how well the model explains the variation in obesity.
Residual Analysis:
Examine residual plots to check for patterns that might indicate model misspecification. For logistic regression, you can look at deviance residuals or Pearson residuals.
Look for outliers, or high leverage points.
Multicollinearity:
If you have highly correlated predictors, check for multicollinearity using variance inflation factors (VIFs). High VIFs can make it difficult to interpret the effects of individual predictors.
Influence Diagnostics:
Look at Cook's distance to identify influential observations that may be disproportionately affecting the model results.
Classification Performance:
If you're interested in predicting obesity, evaluate the model's classification performance using metrics like sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).
Interpretation of Results:

Clearly present the coefficients from your final logistic regression model.
Interpret the coefficients in terms of odds ratios. Explain how changes in the predictor variables affect the odds of obesity.
Use confidence intervals to assess the statistical significance of the effects.
Specifically answer the questions of interest. Has obesity changed over time? What are the differences between the tested groups?
Presentation of Results:

Use well-formatted tables and figures to present your results.
Label everything clearly and concisely.
Ensure that your output is easy to understand.
